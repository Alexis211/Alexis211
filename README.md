### Alex Auvolat -- distributed systems and stuff

ðŸ”­ Currently working on [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/) and [other Deuxfleurs stuff](https://git.deuxfleurs.fr/Deuxfleurs), as well as finishing my PhD thesis.

ðŸŒ± Generally interested in learning about operating systems, distributed computing and programming paradigms.

ðŸ‘¯ We're always looking for new collaborators on the [Deuxfleurs self-hosting project](https://deuxfleurs.fr) (see our [infrastructure repo](https://git.deuxfleurs.fr/Deuxfleurs/infrastructure) for technical stuff in English)

ðŸ’¬ Contact me if you are interested in Deuxfleurs or other stuff I do

ðŸ“« All of my contact information can be found on my [homepage](https://adnab.me)
